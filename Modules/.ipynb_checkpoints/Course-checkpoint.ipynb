    "## 1.3 Imaginary Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "The birth of complex numbers is motivated by the desire to find solutions for polynomial equations. It is easy to see that some polynomials such as $x^2=-1$ do not have any solutions in real numbers. Mathematicians therefore had to take a leap of faith and assume that a solution to such equations does exist. In other words, there is a number that when squared will result in -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "They denoted this number by $i$, such that $i=\\sqrt{-1}$. Indeed, $i^2=-1$. Therefore, the solution to the above equation is $x=i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This new number, $i$, clearly does not exist within the set of real numbers and is aptly called an *imaginary number*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use $i$ to do arithmetic operations. Therefore, $i^2=-1$, $i^3 = i\\times i\\times i = i^2\\times i=-1\\times i=-i$, $i^4=(i^2)^2=1$ and so on. Very soon a pattern emerges that can be used to compute higher powers of $i$."
